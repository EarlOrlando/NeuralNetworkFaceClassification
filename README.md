# NeuralNetworkFaceClassification
Face classification neural networks implemented both with matrices using the NumPy library as well as using the Keras library which is built over TensorFlow. This project contains the features extraction, the neural networks training, and the real-time prediction.  This was designed and implemented as the final project of the "Machine Learning" class which is part of the Master of Computer Systems in the Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESO University).
